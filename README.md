# Diluddit

Dilution of reddit. By 'dilution' I mean injection of latency, see [this](https://howonlee.github.io/2020/02/12/I-20Add-2020-20Seconds-20of-20Latency-20to-20Every-20Website-20I-20Visit.html). Browser extensions work well on your laptop but on mobile the dilution gets quite annoying, especially if you don't control network. But if you create a less awful web-client for reddit while adding the latency those problems are less problematic, inasmuch as people have more control over the web proper.

Not an official reddit project.

Devmode is `npm start`, tests are `npm test`, build is `npm run build`
